## [r128](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/tree/r128) (2020-05-12)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/compare/r127...r128)

- Change specWarnEntomophobia to only warn at 4 stacks and above, up from 3. This should reduce overall annoyance of warning. It's still an important warning but if the warning is making me cuss more than the actual mechanic, it needed adjustment.  
- Update README.md
