## [r126](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/tree/r126) (2020-03-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/compare/r125...r126)

- Fix the last fix  
- Fix a bug in last  
- Added an experimental timer for when Horrific Figments spawn from Dark imagination mask. This seems to have a 1 minute ICD but it doesn't always spawn at exactly one minute either, so this timer is merely reflective of the no spawn window, not a precise timer. It also will only if hostile nameplates are enabled (this option won't enable them if they aren't)  
    Added basic spell announces for Corrupted Blight and Lurking Appendage to better plan pre movement or counter measures such as spell reflect.  
- Just some options checking fixes
