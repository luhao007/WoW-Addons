    Use a template that doesn't have a NineSlice frame
    
    In patch 8.1 Blizzard added a new NineSlice frame to a few templates,
    including the ubiquitous PortraitFrameTemplate. The use of one of these
    templates can sometimes cause a taint error like this:
    
    https://gist.github.com/Gethe/2eebccbe254419748e735fa6aeff8895
    
    Despite this error, I haven't found any trace of this in taint logs. Nor
    have I found a reliable minimum repro. Regardless, this change seems to
    eliminate the above linked error.

    Use the correct widget reference
    
    In 8.1 this won't have a global name, but 8.0 already has the parentKey so we can change it now.
