HandyNotes - Azeroth's Top Tunes
================================


What it does
------------

This addon displays locations of unlearned Garrison music rolls on the worldmap and minimap.
If you also have [TomTom](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom), you can right-click on a marker to create a Waypoint arrow.

Requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to work.


Configuration
-------------

There are a few options you can modify, including:

* Icon size.
* Icon transparency.
* Show all icons, even if you have already learned that music roll.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language, but most of the text is currently only in English.
