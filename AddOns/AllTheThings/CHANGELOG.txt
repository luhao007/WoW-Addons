2.1.5 Release Notes
Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* modified parser to sort the keys within lua tables - modified parser to include structure replacements regardless of the size of the individual values (isle of thunder has a lot of big "crs" tags which now get compressed)
* loot confirmation for the Zod bow from Lady Deathwhisper
* modified db compare tool to reduce the file size of the comparison file and list the information better - changed batch files to stop copying in the entire DBs and just manually move the DIFFs now that the base DB files are all good with the latest patch changes - added API harvest data from 20201112
* dont force quests which are repeatable to be considered collectible in popout quest chain lists
* fixed minilist sorting instances which do not have difficulty headers (fixes #613)
* added Ctrl + Click functionality into the Tooltip information for ATT window rows since not knowing this is possible seems to be why everyone always asks for a 'collapse all' setting (closes #601)
* moved recipe drops for AQ20 into CBD (fixes #565) - moved recipe drops for AQ40 into CBD (fixes #566) - modified auto-expand logic for minilist to not expand a group to which a character is already saved (i.e. killed world boss/rare) (fixes #455) - adjusted descriptions for Krokuun achievement (fixes #437) - ignore data under the harvester DBs folder
* Insane mode once again requires Breadcrumbs and Heirloom Upgrades
* fix 'concatenate a nil value' hopefully (but not sure why it happens in the first place?)
* added previously NYI cloak which only drops from relinquished token... fml
* parser removes the Uncollectable file stuff now
* added some hackery for Marks of Honor to force them to not show any Contains content in the tooltip, but still provide the data via the normal popout functionality by manually linking the item into chat. This way people don't randomly get huge lag spikes when they cursor over MoH accidentally
* removed random achievement links from the main list top-groups (except Holiday) since there are now fancy icons in place!
* replaced some of the existing icons with new custom icons for some of the common group headers (there's more that can be changed still, but for example...)
