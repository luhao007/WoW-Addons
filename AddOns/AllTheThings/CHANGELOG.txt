Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* couple maps in castle nathria (so far)
* conduit from calling box
* simplified caching functionality - added option to search for data only using cached data - skip refreshing windows before the game is even loaded - simplified logic for moving/resizing the windows - modified scrollbar logic to only move by 1 instead of fractionally - simplified scrollbar value change logic due to step constraint - consolidated reagent cache state value
* do not auto-collapse a character's saved groups when Account Mode is enabled (fixes #632, fixes #629)
* account-wide reputation collection returns the proper other-character saved value (fixes #629 for real) - minilist sorting will now only be performed if the top-level header is NOT tied to an Instance since relying on current difficulty is not super reliable (fixes #628)
* moved encounter tooltip progress summary onto its own line since it seems basically impossible to account for overlapping text with how tooltips work (fixes #645)
* priest calling conduit
* what is going on with BuildContains....
* fixed 'Contains' logic for the 925th time
* clean up
* modified in-game harvester to re-try harvesting item sources if the existing source is now non-existent
* re-harvest + re-parse (fixes #634)
* used the same logic for pulling 'task' from the map APIs into /attwq as for 'storyline' quest objects so that static quests with no rewards don't show up by themselves in the window - tagged mystery quest 49369 as world quest since it comes back from the 'task' API even though it's not a real quest
* various SL updates
* the 'Not in ATT' line for Accepted/Completed quests is now Red for easier visibility - playing catch up of my many screenshots taken over the last week...
* added ability to create a generic Dropdown in the Settings - added Tooltip Setting to require a key modifier for showing Tooltip info (closes #646)
* tooltip modifier key now only affects some UI-based tooltips (items/spells/etc) not World-based tooltips
* fixed the BRF Blackhand quest items which still had nested Quest objects - yet another revision to 'Contains'/Search logic! tune in next time for the next problem that shows up... - modified SearchForObjectClone to try to find a filter-inclusive group first
* fixed source quest list for things which have source quests but are not quests
* necrolord treasure coord - reverted some 'Contains' changes because it made other things not work as expected.... tune in again next time
* added some zone drops for CN (though they don't seem to have source ID's currently...) - added sire denathrius quest item - couple conduits from calling box - revendreth zone drop
* commented out the temp DB from Beta which had things in it that have changed in live - fixed difficulties/sourceIDs for castle nathria - harvested again to fix sourceIDs for stuff
* crs for Grand Theft Shadehound
* quite a revamp to the Contains/Search consolidation logic, hopefully this works for everything...? - fixed the quest chain requirements window to only perform quest chain logic for root quest objects, or objects with a source quest (this way rares/etc. with a questID attached don't show in a quest chain requirements window when popped out) - removed currency build logic in popout groups for now since it became broken at some point - a questID for Maw rare
* fixed tooltip progress text for standalone collectible items - fixed achievement criteria showing 'Contains' as if they were their parent achievement - removed extra logic from Contains which excluded listing the same group as was originally searched (since the search logic now properly collapses the matching group prior to hitting Contains)
* added sourceQuests to the Dead Blanchy mount unlock to help show the order of obtaining to those who do not track quests/enable debug - modified some descriptions for Blanchy due to varying costs of the blanket

Contributions made by Gromwind:
* Moved some achievements into OZ > Bastion and added some coordinates / descriptions.
* Adding achievements erroneously removed in previous commit.
* Added additional Buckled <armour type> Belt items to All-in-One Belt Repair Kit.
