Contributions made by ImUnicke:
* added parser functionality to 'drop' fields from harvest data so they do not interfere with source data (in the case where a known issue is found with blizzard's API data or old DB harvest) - removed logic trying to fix blizzard's original allied race mistakes in API data, since incomplete lists of races caused inaccurate corrections - added "_drop" to the two exile's reach quests with duplicated API rewards
* Merge pull request #581 from Cieper/patch-1
* adjusted Horde War campaign source quests to better reflect additional storyline-split requirements
* added setting option to display Quest Chain Requirements in a nested manner such that quest completion is performed inside-out - modified logic for Quest Chain Requirements due to some obsolete references - modified logic for displaying tooltip Quest requirement information to not omit anything when in Debug mode - re-worded quest tooltip information
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings
* modified item DB compare tool to compare multiple DBs of the same 'type' in sequence and store a DIFF DB for each DB iteration. This will allow me to only push the DIFF DB for each API harvest instead of the entire harvest DB each time
* harvested items/quests for 20201018 with diffs and updated compare information - modified harvester from stopping immediately if something goes wrong - cleaned up and consolidated logic for duplicating groups within the parser (would like to do similar for items/NPCs but things dont all work the same right now... and it bloats the addon by like 40% if done for items currently) - removed alt quests from pushing the respective group as the quest into the quest DB - added/commented some initial code for potentially being able to duplicate Sourced groups under items or NPC objects - added fishing requirement to some quests in Mechagon - added Arachnoid Harvester entry for the alternate Timeline with description as to the difference - removed extra item/quest DBs since the diffs are already included with new data
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings
* reparsed from merge
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings
* added broken shore WQ - hopefully push before new categories shows up again ahhhhhhhhhh
* fixed Quests/items with sub-groups being ignored when building the 'Contains' or popout list for an NPC or Encounter
* tiny adjustment to 'Contains' to allow 1 more layer of nested content and increase the indent increase per layer by 1 space
* compressed the Nemesis achievements into the Warlord achievement in both Achievements and Garrison > Buildings since each achievement was being duplicated twice within the same hierarchy of the database
* added logic for NPC and Objects to consider the 'altQuests' tag - applied 'altQuests' to quests in Exlie's Reach so that quest tracking does not show the quests themselves for high-level characters, or any character which has completed the Exlie's Reach questline [WIP]
* compressed some interface settings and wording to save space in the settings screen - added a new value settings slider for the Summarize Things (Contains) list for how many entries may show in the list
* only treat encounters as completed if the current character has it currently completed
* missing WQs
* fixed "Nested Source Quests" functionality to not include items rewarded by any quests, as the main intent of the functionality is to show all necessary and breadcrumb pre-requisites for a given quest to aid in thorough quest completion
* cleaned up the Nested Quest Chain logic so that duplicate quests are no longer listed - consolidated altQuest logic for Exile's Reach so it's much less 'spammy' in the source - fixed some H/A Quest IDs in Exlie's Reach for proper source quests - removed An End to Beginnings from being an altquest for quests which are required to complete it during the chain - added some altquests to Orgrimmar quests which take place after Exile's Reach - fixed horde quest ID for 'Mission Statement'
* added Monk source quest for Exile's Reach (thanks Sanct)
* adjusted quest completion logic to consider account-mode rather than account-wide quests in some situations - comments
* removed quest from HQT which is an actual quest sourced in stormwind
* added a sub-toggle of Quest tracking for specifically tracking Breadcrumbs, defaulting to OFF (since they are so annoying and cause many problems) - modified tooltip for Quest tracking based on addition of Breadcrumb-specific tracking - added a tooltip for account-wide Quest tracking as to its function in the addon - fixed Settings checkboxes to only have hover functionality aligned with their specific text rather than arbitrary size - modified Quest collection tracking to account for Breadcrumb tracking as well as make all objects with Quests to track completion in a consistent way (Items/NPCs/Objects/Quests)
* some commented code for potentially having faction-colored quest names (probably would put it into a setting) - modified logic for Nested Source Quests to prevent an A-B-A infinite loop situation
* modified Nested Quest logic so that breadcrumb source quests are always used at the parent quest as well
* added a completion icon to entries in the Contains list if they are trackable (i.e. Quest on Blingtron tooltip)
* only show the extra 'saved' icon in the Contains list if the Thing is not already collectible - missing WQ in broken shore
* added in-game support for 'reqlvl' tag which may include both min and max level requirements - added parser support for interpreting 'reqlvl' source tags - modified parser to yell at the contributor if they incorrectly set a numeric array field with a non-array value so hopefully it gets fixed (but the parser will correctly parse the data anyway if it's numeric) - added required level of Exile's Reach of 1-18 - added required level of Ny'alotha of 50
* removed remainder of WQ achievements/criteria from BFA source files by linking their quests from the achievements file - added missing Boxing Match achievements for A/H into the Achievements > PvP > World section
* fixed parser duplicate coordinate comparison
* fixed breadcrumbs still showing in account-mode with breadcrumb tracking off (they are just very persistent and want to be collected) - cleaned up some logic because i learn more about tables
* fixed DB compare tool which wasn't comparing keys sometimes to actually provide the difference into the DIFF DB
* added harvester parsing support for 'reqlvl' instead of 'lvl' - removed harvester from adding the 'max required level' from blizz API since it's definitely not accurate in many places - fixed parser merging for 'reqlvl' tag so that merging two minimum levels doesn't turn into a min and max level - added 'reqlvl' to merge properly for items - commented some unused code in parser - re-parsed harvested DBs from 20201018 as 20201024 with new 'reqlvl' information
* commented out grand commendations since the in-game API is currently returning inaccurate information regarding faction bonuses for MoP factions which is why these show as uncollected for some players - added faction info for the sunreaver insignias to grand commendation file - cleaned up duplicated faction tags from isle of thunder insignias
* ignore the actual DBs since only the DIFFs are being pushed now
