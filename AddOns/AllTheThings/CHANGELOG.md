### KNOWN ISSUES

Please don't spam us with these:

- Map icon is inside the minimap.
- You can't change profiles because the switch button is not functional.
- The autoreset on dungeons seems broken in `/attra`.


### Logic fixes

- Fixed ATT tooltips not showing up/disappearing.
- Fixed "This gets removed in patch 10.0.0" on Things that are already removed. We are in 10.0 patch after all!


### Data fixes

- Harvested Item/Quest/Achievement data, this should make new content behave as collectable and show up in lists.
