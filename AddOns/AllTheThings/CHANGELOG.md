### Highlights of this update

Mainly fixes after the last release that had lots of reworked logic.

### Notable changes:

- Recipe reagents in the tradeskill UI will once again properly show ATT information.
- For all you Unique collectors out there fixed a special case when Blizzard returns invalid data about items. You will see in the tooltip if you need another manual refresh (Shift+Click) to fix it.
- Fixed tooltips showing "---" when using "Collection Progress > Icon Only".
- Fixed Recipes not showing collection status in tooltip.
- "Known by" list is properly alphabetized again.
- Drop chance logic:
    - Best Loot Spec chance now shows all specs which were calculated to have the same best chance
    - Adjusted alignment/colors for drop chances
- Added "Sarge's Tale", new Hearthstone mount. In order to receive this mount, complete Hearthstone's Mercenaries Mode tutorial and send your party on a mission.

### Known issues:
If you track recipes, some extra things (like talents or "Revive all Battle Pets" abilities) will have the "Collected/Not collected" text.
