[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.9.5...SL-2.9.6) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Functional changes

- Modified Quests slightly such that any normally uncollectible Quests marked as providing reputation up to a certain threshold with a faction will now show as a 'Cost' for the respective Faction instead of showing as Uncollected. Example: repeatable Sporeggar quests that you can do for rep.


### Logic fixes

- Removed accidentally left debug print.
- We will no longer consider all Shadowlands legendary craftable ranks collected when you craft the first rank. This bug was present the whole expansion!


### Data fixes

- Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King achievements adjustments.
- Brewfest, Hallow's End achievements adjustments.
- Moved a bunch of mount achievements out of Feats of Strength and into where they belong.
