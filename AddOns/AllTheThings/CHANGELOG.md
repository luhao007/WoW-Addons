[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.6.9...SL-2.6.10) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Notable changes:

- Delayed some event registration until after ATT is ready to handle them.

- Fixed minilist Professions category not capturing certain 'Profession' content.
- Micro-adjustments to minilist tech.

- Fixed Legion engineering questline.
- Random duplicate quests removed.
- More quests added and fixed.
- Other fixes.
