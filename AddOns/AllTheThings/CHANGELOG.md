# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.9.12](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.9.12) (2022-10-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.9.11...SL-2.9.12) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Functional changes

- Added a bit of logic for Nested Source Quests in case very strange situations can still cause infinite loops and to report the offending quest.
- If you care about level filtering we will consider Shadowlands content as level 48+ and Dragonflights as 58+ now (was 50+ and 60+ respectively).
- Couple minor performance improvements for full Quest completion checking.


### Logic fixes

- Removed an unnecessary window refresh on some events.


### Data fixes

- Removed more duplicated profession quests after recent profession changes (Enchanting, Blacksmithing).
- Moved all Blacksmithing quests to their respective source locations.
- More various quest fixes here and there.
- More WotLK content adjustments that have some spillover effect of Retail content (Achievements in Dalaran and zones, updated Ulduar, etc).
- Other fixes.
