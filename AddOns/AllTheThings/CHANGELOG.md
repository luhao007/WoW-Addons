### Highlight of this update

Sanctum of Domination Bind-on-Equip items are here, thanks for reports, everyone!

### Notable changes:

- In a follow up to the previous update, repeated groups of treasures will now have a checkmark when you have opened all treasures in the group until next reset
- Also fixed a bug that put checkmark on treasures that you haven't opened
- Recipes which are BoE will properly 'pretend' they are BoP if not collecting Recipes Account-Wide (this is behaviour pre-2.3.5)
- Some Mark of Honor logic improvements, feel free to do `/att item:137642` (or `/att ` and Shift+Left-click on the MoH to create a link!) and tell us if anything is wrong
- More rare/Adventure drops, treasure/rare coordinates/descriptions, recipes, dailies, etc
- Various fixes
