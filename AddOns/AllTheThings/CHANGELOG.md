[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.1...SL-2.3.2) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

AllTheThings 2.3.2 is now out, so you might get some motivation to play WoW again.

### Here are the 2 biggest highlights of this Update:


#### 1) Covenant Filter!
We now have a (working) Covenant Filter, so you only see Covenant Items that are specific to your covenant. You can change the behavior on Filters tab of settings. Your choice.


#### 2) PvP Items Update!
Huge PvP Update for both Users & Developers of ATT.
Big Thanks to @Braghe - Margeary for helping with PvP!

##### What changed?
Most PvP Items will now have 2 Sources with a couple of items having more sources if applicable.
Once under the PvP Tab as general overview & once under their specific Source such as a vendor.

##### Future of 50,000+ PvP Items:
In the next update of AllTheThings (2.3.3), we will add a PvP Filter, to filter any item/achievement for "Player vs Player activities or a currency related to those activities".
But until then please report any Errors you see, especially related to PvP Items, so we can fix bugs!

#### When does 2.3.3 Release?
SoooOoooon! Sometime after 2.3.2, no exact date yet, but before 9.1 for sure.
There will be a small post once the PvP Filter is out on Git if you want to enjoy the good life.

#### Bonus!
We are always looking for people who want to help with ATT development, even if you are a beginner.
You can pick which version you want to help with, be it Retail, Classic, BCC or even the PTR.
Pick any area such as general PvE, PvP Stuff, Pet battles, Druid items or Unsorted and much more. Your choiceÂ²

We will guide you!
