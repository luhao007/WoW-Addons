Huge thanks to Braghe and AlexSoft for playing on PTR and adding Things to ATT â™¥

### Notable changes:

- ATT will once again print a message in chat when learning a SourceID which was already 'collected' by being a shared appearance to another known appearance while in Unique Mode. The message should actually represent if any additional appearances were 'collected' due to the learned SourceID. (i.e. an already 'collected' appearance would now simply say "Item ... added" vs. a new appearance would include how many shared appearances have been collected in total like before "Item ... [+X] has been added").
- Added an additional check when accepting a quest to report if ATT thinks the quest is not in the game.
- Removed currency groups from remaining collectible when under completed repeatable groups. (No reason to force them to stay visible when the quest cannot be completed... when the quests become unflagged, the currency will show again).
- Including an extra line of information in certain tooltips of an ATT window when the group may have additional information available when 'popped out' (i.e. right clicked) due to other content listed elsewhere in the addon, but related to the current group.
- 'Common Boss Drops' will also expand inside instances.
- Attempted to fix Garrison Followers list freezing the game completely (unsuccessfully for now but we are getting close).
- Cleaned up lots of duplicated quests (thanks Runawaynow!).
- Added lots of missing and removed from game quests from Mists of Pandaria (thanks Darkal and jewel_king!).
- Synced battleground and Love is in the Air with Classic ATT.
- Other fixes.
