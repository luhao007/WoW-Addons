- Retail: Instead of accepting unknown additional parameters for searches (this is never used in any possible way currently, and was only accounted for by Azerite Essence Rank logic) we now accept an optional 'options' table to allow defining some adjustments to how the search is performed (this logic can likely migrate to Classic also, but haven't checked yet)  
    Retail: Popouts no longer perform their 'fill' operation within the synchronous context of the search operation or right-click operation which generate the popout, and instead are now delayed into the asynchronous context after being put into the resulting popout window  
    Mark of Honor no longer need special handling within the tooltip logic since it properly handles filling based on its search context (rather than externally needing inputs which drive skipped filling)  
    Fixed a logic issue where filled purchases of a popout would use the general skip check level and not fill necessary purchases
