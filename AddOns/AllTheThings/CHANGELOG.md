## [4.0.19](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/4.0.19) (2024-10-20)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/4.0.18...4.0.19) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

- I break things down, but not by force,  
    I turn tangled words into a clearer course.  
    A guide through code, I sort and arrange,  
    From jumbled mess to meaning, I change.  
    What am I?  
- Fix some minor errors  
- Retail: coords and spreading the light hqts  
- Cata: Disabled achievement automation on Twenty-Five Tabards.  
- TWW: Update some coordinates in Azj-Kahet  
    Partially revert commit 97c749063ac1137083f09de4d92d187ace3710b0  
    Clean-up comments section of the HQTs  
    Missing quest data/givers referred in the comments are most likely related to Dor'garad and Kaheti Excavations as they are yet to be implemented  
- coord  
- Update Uldum.lua  
    Uldum: Harrison Jones not spawning after cutscenes  
- Fixed location for Candy Bucket â€” Dustwallow Marsh, Mudsprocket.  
- Found a new Radiant Remnant but didn't get the objectID :weary:  
- Fixed implementation of the 'Stonevault Mechsuit' so it's not listed inside of the Quest Starter Item (bad!)  
- Couple minor adjustments to 'Total Cost' logic and 'Source Quest Requirements' so that a quest chain with multiple Costs will properly show all costs of the quest chain (may adjust more with further testing over time)  
    Fixed Quest Provider Items which get shown in Quest chains from possibly being permanently visible in the Main list  
- Strip Trial of Style ensemble quests  
- DF PvP Ensembles added  
- Confirmed 100% Trial of Style Ensembles (there's way more Items than you thought you got!)  
- Fixed FlightPath Bug  
- Classic TWs  
- [Localization] Update zhTW.  
- TWW: Update a few coordinates in Azj-Kahet  
- Added 'accepted or' text to the tooltip for pre-requisite quests of a Thing since our representation for simply 'accepting' a quest to be available is identical to having to 'complete' a quest  
- Parser: Now supports 'extraTransmogSetSpells' used within an 'iensemble' object to define additional non-Item TransmogSet spells which trigger automatically when learning the base Ensemble  
    Added 'extraTransmogSetSpells' to the 'Ensemble: Heritage of the Draenei' as an example  
    Added new 'EnsembleSpell' Type for Ensemble Spells which derive only from Spells and not Items  
- Cata: Updated objectives for Mauti.  
- Cata: Updated objectives for The Hunter's Revenge.  
- Cata: Updated objectives for Serpents and Poison.  
- Fixed a missing parameter for the Factions class.  
- Cata: Tricks and Treats of Azeroth hasn't been removed yet. Thanks Blizzard.  
- TWW candy bucket quests and placeholder comments for provider / coord to be added once event goes live (everything already came in with 11.0.2 so it's timelined that way, even though the event will start at the same time when 11.0.5 goes live)  
- Sourced remaining anniversary achievements + updated wago files + parsed for retail and ptr  
- Added TypicalCharacterCollected & TypicalAccountCollected to encapsulate the simplest typical cache-checking for collected Things  
    Added use of these 'typical' collected functions where currently-applicable in Classes  
    Now using simple collectible swap for Toys  
- NPC 145707 is Mobile  
- Couple Heritage quest details

- TWW/Azj-Kahet: Fix an issue with inaccurate-quest reports related to Rumors  
- Adjusted the repeatable Hallow's End quests to be nested as you need to be on the holiday quest to have them appear. This matches similar quest objective layouts.  
- Retail: FillGroups now only triggers the OnWindowFillComplete event for the filled window if it actually filled the root group of that window (e.g. FIllGroups can be triggered on individual groups in some cases and we don't want that to trigger this event over and over on the hosting window)  
- Fixed Item-based Things which are keyed as another ID as considering themselves 'missing'  
- Fixed some Hallow's End coordinates for Vashj'ir.  
- Deleted unused achievement criteria data in Hallow's End. (we use automation now!)

- Cata: Fixed some phaseID assignments for Engineering recipes that came out with the Molten Front.

    Moved the GetDisplayID logic from Model.lua to NPC.lua now that it's being used by Classic  
- Cleaning up any potential reference in non-db code to a singular "cr" field. (crs or creatureID is the standard)

    Contributor ignore tables now use proper metatables  
- Fix some reported retail errors  
- Fixed some more scuffed iconIDs.

- Retail: ATT Windows no longer have explicit StartProcessing/StopProcessing functions defined. Instead (the only current use case) has been converted into an Event: OnWindowFillComplete. This Event (currently un-used externally) is triggered for a given Window when the FillGroups process is completed within that Window.  
    Retail: ATT Windows no longer preemptively define some empty group data when created since we always use 'SetData' properly  
    Retail: The 'Source(s)' group in popouts is now considered source-ignored  
- Retail: Recipes filled into popouts don't need to forcibly not merge, and can be created if not Sourced
