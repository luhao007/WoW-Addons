- prep new tag  
- Small bugfix  
- Make nexus king mythic public now that 3 guilds have it down  
- some more normal and heroic fixes  
- Rework Araz to handle early phase 2 pushes and more accurately start p2 timers whether pushed by time OR health.  
- Add arcane convergence cast alert by request  
- Fix dimensius and nexus king to return correct highest health on wipe (since both bosses heal after P1). this will fix for example dimensius reporting that your best pulll was a 1% wipe after stage 1 because in stage 1 he dropped that low.
