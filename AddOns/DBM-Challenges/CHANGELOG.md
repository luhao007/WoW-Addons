- Apparently this lua error has been there since Legion, and no one reported it until shadowlands (and they chose to report it on curse which I don't read, oops). This will fix lua errors happening any time Fixate stage starts, as well as now have the timers working on fixate stage starts as well for twins encounter.  
- eliminate redundancy
