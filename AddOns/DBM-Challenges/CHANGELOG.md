- Two new spell trackings  
    This is two main spells for the boss https://www.wowhead.com/npc=153174/watchers-of-death  
- Kill withering interrupt timer for now since it's inconsistent between diff mobs that use it on top of whether or not previous cast was interrupted or not and how long spell lockout was (seems to affect timing of next cast). Probably not going to go omnotron defense level of effort into this timer.  
- Added interrupt, dispel, and nameplate option for soul of mist
