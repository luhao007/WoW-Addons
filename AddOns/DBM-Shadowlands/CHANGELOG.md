    Need transcriptor log to see the now working stage 3 timers, since using WCL to fix this is a bit difficult when Damage and Avoid scripts cast same spell on normal :D  
- simplify terros, it's same on mythic heroic and normal, at this point assume this encounter designer didn't hate boss mod authors and made it easy for us :D  
- Dathia normal mode update  
- really don't like working on this boss  
- First pass on normal Sennarth.  
- Several fixes/updates to broodkeeper from normal testing  
- Push senarth mythic. like 20 groups killed that on testing.  
    Should also fix stage 2 detection for normal mode testing.

- Guild combat messages upgraded! - Group leader will now be included in all guild raid messages to make it easy to tell which guild group message is about for guilds that have multiple teams (Note: All localisations need to be updated and message will display in english until each language is submitted) - Wrath classic will now show raid difficulty in guild messages. This was incorrectly turned off for all classic flavors (including wrath). It'll now execute retails code path that displays raid difficulty.  
- Push finished council mod  
- Update Sennarth from heroic testing, it's still kinda WIP because I'd like to see some combat log events get added that can better narrow down more precise timer resets/transitions, but this will be passable for now.  
    Some bug fixes/updates for mythic terros as well  
- Fix some obvious bugs, most test analysis will fix more  
- Fixed wrong object type
