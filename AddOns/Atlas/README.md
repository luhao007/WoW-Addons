## About Atlas
Atlas is an addon for World of Warcraft that includes detailed maps for every
instance in the game. Originally, Blizzard neglected to include maps for
instances. However, after a number of years Blizzard began to include official
maps for some instances. These official maps are in the same hand-drawn style
as the built-in world maps. Conversely, the Atlas maps are based on data used
by the minimap, which provides a more detailed, accurate, and colorful
representation. You can think of this as the difference between a street map
and a satellite image.

Furthermore, while the built-in maps mark the locations of some major bosses,
Atlas provides detailed and accurate information about all of the creatures,
NPCs, objects, and events you'll encounter in each dungeon. General information
about each zone is provided as well, including its location, level range,
player limit, attenuation requirement, and associated faction. All entrances,
exits, portals, and connections are labelled clearly. Because there are so many
instances in the game, you can categorize them by type, level, number of
players, continent, or expansion.

Finally, in addition to instances, Atlas comes with a handful of optional
components that add even more maps. These include outdoor encounter maps,
global transportation maps, dungeon location maps, and battleground maps. Each
optional component can be enabled, disabled or removed individually. A number
of third-party Atlas extensions are available as well, which further augment
the functionality of Atlas. AtlasLoot is the most popular of these, providing
detailed drop and item information for every encounter, but there are also
packages for quest information and major city maps as well.
