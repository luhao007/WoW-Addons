# HandyNotes: Mists of Pandaria (Treasures and Rares)

A HandyNotes plugin to show the various treasures and rares of Pandaria on your map.

They're rare spawns, so they're not guaranteed to be there... but at least you'll know where to look.

Items that you've already collected won't be displayed. (This uses the "flag" quests that the game relies on to keep track of the items. Sometimes these glitch; generally if they do so, you also won't have gotten achievement-credit, so you'll likely still be interested in the item.)

Requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes).

To edit the settings, visit the HandyNotes config panel, expand the "Plugins" section, and click on "LostAndFound". You can then choose which achievements to show, and whether to show ones you've already found.
