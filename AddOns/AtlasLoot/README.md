## About AtlasLoot Enhanced

AtlasLoot Enhanced is an UI mod allowing for loot tables of bosses to be browsed whenever needed within the game. This version is for the latest retail version of WoW.

## History

AtlasLoot was originally created by Pernicius as a plugin for Atlas and contained a handful of raid loot tables to browse. Unfortunately, Pernicius was unable to maintain the mod, so Daviesh took over and renamed it to AtlasLoot Enhanced to provide a distinction between the two versions. Since that time, AtlasLoot has grown to cover every loot table for every boss, every item set, PvP Items and items for every reputation faction. In January 2010 Hegarol took over the project from Daviesh. In 2014/2015 Lag completely rewrote the entire addon for AtlasLoot v8. Currently it is being updated and maintained by nanderson11.

## Features

*   **Atlas (fork) Integration:** You can easily link to Atlas map browser if your current visited instance loot table has a corresponding map provided in Atlas (fork).
*   **Favorites/Wishlist:** Alt-click on any item to add it to favorites, alt-clicking on an item in favorites deletes it.
*   **Dressing Room:** Control-click items to show them in the Dressing Room.
*   **Price Preview:** See the prices for token items like PvP rewards.
*   **Filter:** Filter loot tables based on your class.
*   **Instance Loot:** All instance loot from every Dungeon and Raid.
