- TOC Bump  
- Update README.md  
- Fix #20 (#21)  
    ```  
    If Babblet reaches the targeted player, she will cast Severe Dusting (Damage), causing heavy damage and blinding the player for 4 seconds  
    Babblet will choose a new Severe Dusting (CD) target each time she casts Severe Dusting (Damage) on her target, or when the 12-second Severe Dusting (CD) channel expires  
    ```  
    Since Babblet reaches the target, it causes the CD to start again. Change the `:Start` call to an `:Update` call to shut up this error.
