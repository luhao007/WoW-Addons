[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/compare/v11.1.5-1.0.7...v11.1.5-1.0.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases)

- Merge pull request #4853 from syrifgit/survival  
    Improve Lunar Storm Tracking  
- Updated Protection Warrior  
    - Changed Revenge threshold to be settings.reserve\_rage + 20 instead of 40. There is no reason for it to be 40 and it simply means there is no button to press, if you are between 20 and 40 rage with both Shield Slam and Thunder Clap on CD. It might make sense to change execute to 20 as well. Though I understand that the 40 setting is for the max damage of execute.  
- Demo haste fixes and helper expressions  
- Fix recs when mounting, etc.  
- Shadow comment  
- Aether Attunement Counter  
- Fix Alter Time  
- Fix Burden of Power order of operations  
    This was reflecting a change Blizzard made to Burden of Power, however when they reverted the change we did not. It now matches in-game behaviour (The same cast cannot generate/consume Burden/Glorious).

- Use debuff tracking for Lunar Storm  
    It's very consistent and timely now, due to recent flurry of aura changes/fixes re: unfurling darkness. Unfortunately SIMC uses different syntax, so notes were added to the top of the files.  
- fix: classify Tome of Light's Devotion as a crit-cooldown trinket  
    Reclassify Tome of Light's Devotion tanking trinket as a cooldown  
    trinket that provides critical strike rating, which is how it's used in  
    practice.  
- fix: improve support for Tome of Light's Devotion tanking trinket  
    * Fix cooldown to 90s from 120s.  
    * Rename the `radiance` buff to `radiance_tome` to match  
      SimulationCraft. `radiance` is the buff name for the Darkmoon Deck:  
      Radiance buff in SimulationCraft.  
    * Change the `handler` to correctly rotate the buff for the trinket when  
      its on-use ability is activated. This matches current trinket  
      behavior as of 11.1.5.  
    * Add `radiant_verses` and `resilience_verses` buffs to track the  
      stacking buff gained from being attacked. These names match  
      SimulationCraft.
