# Hekili

**Hekili** is a powerful, highly configurable **priority helper** for **World of Warcraft**. It supports **all üó°Ô∏èDPS and üõ°Ô∏èTank specializations**. ‚ûïHealer specializations are supported with a focus on **DPS abilities**, great for solo content or downtime during PvE.

[‚û°Ô∏è Latest Release](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases/latest)

## ‚ú® What Does It Do?

Hekili helps you play more effectively by recommending which abilities to use during combat. 

Its **key feature** is the display of multiple upcoming sequential actions, allowing you to plan ahead instead of reacting to a single, constantly changing icon. This approach reduces tunnel vision and helps you stay focused on the encounter itself.

These recommendations are provided using **Action Priority List (APL) logic** inherited from [**SimulationCraft**](https://www.simulationcraft.org) and [**RaidBots**](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot). This integration helps ensure consistency between your in-game decisions and the tools you already use to optimize talents, gear, and stats. APLs are **frequently updated** to reflect changes in class balance, mechanics, and theorycrafting.

**Hekili** can help:
- Increase your damage output
- Learn and master new specializations
- Improve consistency and compare your decisions against theorycrafted simulations

## üîß How Does It Work?

**Hekili** uses your current character state ‚Äî including cooldowns, resources, buffs/debuffs, and enemies nearby ‚Äî to **simulate several spells into the future** using your spec‚Äôs APL logic. It assumes you follow its recommendations in sequence.

If you cast something else, the addon **immediately re-evaluates** your game state and updates its suggestions in real time.

Other features include:
- Optional Separate Displays for:
  - AoE abilities
  - Cooldowns
  - Defensives
  - Interrupts
    - Guides you to interrupt late in the enemy cast
    - Filter recommendations to Mythic+ priority spells
- Toggle controls for cooldowns, defensives, interrupts, potions:
  - You can manually control whether major abilities like 2-minute cooldowns are used by enabling or disabling toggle options.
  - These toggles can be bound to hotkeys or macros, giving you flexible control on a fight-by-fight basis.
  - Rather than using the toggles, you can display these abilities in a dedicated Cooldowns display, allowing you to cast them manually when timing is ideal.
  - This system is especially powerful when paired with encounter knowledge ‚Äî for example, holding cooldowns for a burn phase or add wave can result in substantial DPS gains.
- Compatible with **ElvUI**, **Bartender**, and other UI mods
- Customization
  - Choose from several display styles to match your needs ‚Äî from a single Automatic display to AoE-specific or dual-display setups
  - Tailor the look and feel: adjust icon size, spacing, layout, fonts, and transparency
  - Show spell keybindings on icons, or swap out the default icon for another spell or texture
  - Disable individual abilities to fit your playstyle ‚Äî for example, if you prefer to macro an on-use trinket into your cooldown, you can hide that trinket from the queue entirely
  - Advanced users can edit or create their own action lists using familiar **SimulationCraft-style syntax**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install the Addon**

There are two main ways to install **Hekili**:

- **Addon Managers** (recommended): Automatically install and keep the addon up to date
- **Manual Download**: Install it yourself from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/releases/latest) by extracting the `.zip` to `Interface/AddOns`

#### Recommended Addon Managers
Because **Hekili** is frequently updated, we suggest using one of these trusted tools:
- [**CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/download) ‚Äì A widely used manager for all types of addons. We recommend the standalone desktop version for Windows or macOS to avoid extra overlays.
- [**Wago App**](https://addons.wago.io/download) ‚Äì Ideal if you also use **WeakAuras**, **Plater scripts**, or other Wago-hosted content.
- [**WowUp**](https://wowup.io/) ‚Äì Supports both **CurseForge** and **Wago** backends, and includes its own addon library. We suggest using the **CurseForge** version unless you use another tool to manage your WeakAuras.
- [**CurseBreaker**](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker) (for üí™ power users) ‚Äì A lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool that supports **Wago**, **WoWInterface**, **Tukui**, **ElvUI**, **GitHub**, and more. No extra setup is needed for **WoWInterface**-based updates.

### 2. Configure In-Game

Use the minimap icon or the command: `/hekili`
