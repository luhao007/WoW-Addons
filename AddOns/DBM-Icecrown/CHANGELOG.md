- also check string and Id for good measure, cover all bases. Classic likes using old or different tech

     - Updated several things to use more modern features  
     - Changed several icons used to prefer lower index over higher index. Modern mods favor lower index so skull and X aren't used if they don't have to be (thus allowing raid leaders to actually use them for marking kill targets). legacy mods tended to favor using those icons and it just doesn't align with current mod design.  
     - Changed a few target warnings to be non filtered target warnings if warning was deemed important and if it didn't have a special announce (ie it was the only warning for that spell).  
- Fix option type
