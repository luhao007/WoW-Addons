[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/compare/r308...r309) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/releases)

- fix missed line  
- Bump TOC files  
- You know what's nice when "teleport in 10 seconds" actually occurs 10 seconds before and not 20.  
- Show spore count in announce  
- Fix bad option spellId  
- turn off frost blast timer by default since it has an extreme timer variance.  
- Fix fissure on KT so it has voice pack support again  
- Fixed a bug with iron council, horseman, and faction champinos were wipe HP would report lowest HP instead of highest  
- Bump hotfix and minsync on drakes to todays date  
- more work around for blizzard bugs, this time further throttling on void zones on sarth. It appears that the drakes are not only firing ENCOUNTER\_START when they land on sarth, but also  running their solo encounter scripts too, resulting in extra extra void zones. It's basically sarth+3drakes+drake+drake+drake  
- Fix a bug wehre yell or warning may show multiple times on thaddius  
- Fix initial 25 man doom timer on loatheb  
- Adjustments to account for fact SUCCESS still doesn't have target in classic so more features had to be turned off there.  
    Update minsync for shadron, tenabron and vesperon so they don't sync bad combat starts and require an up to date core/module  
    Fixed count not being on the doom timer on Loatheb  
    adjusted KT phase 2 timer to be 1 second faster  
- Update README.md
