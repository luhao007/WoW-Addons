About AtlasQuest:
=================

AtlasQuest is an addon for another World of Warcraft addon called
"Atlas".    AtlasQuest adds a panel to the side of Atlas that lists
most quests for a given Dungeon, Raid or Battleground.

It was originally created by Asurn in 2006.  Since July 2007 it has
been maintained and updated by Thandrenn (aka Mystery8 or Thanbini).

In January of 2023, Zilom contributed many updates and fixes to the 
XML and LUA code to restore some functionality and make AtlasQuest
work with the Dragonflight expansion.  

Over the years there have been many contributions by the community.
Most are listed either here or in the changelog.txt.

Information for AtlasQuest is gathered either first-hand in the game 
or from WoWhead.com.
