- SetColor option for a bar, which is obeyed over barList:SetColorAt
- SetColor option for a barList
- Possibilities, unsure:
	- Method to hide/disable the spark on a bar.
	- Make the barList frame sized for the entire group, and add backdrop
		options to it.
	- Not sure if this should be in the addon's hands or not, but I could see
		it being useful for counter bars to be able to show a line or spark at
		each point in the count.  So a counter bar with a max of 5 would have 4
		markers between each value.  Specifically, I could see such a thing
		being used as a stack count indicator for deadly poison or somesuch.
