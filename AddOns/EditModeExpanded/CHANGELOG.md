# Edit Mode Expanded

## [11.0-009](https://github.com/teelolws/EditModeExpanded/tree/11.0-009) (2024-08-24)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/teelolws/EditModeExpanded/compare/11.0-008...11.0-009) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/teelolws/EditModeExpanded/releases)

- Disabled action bars "set icon padding to zero" option due to taint issues  
    Suggest you use an addon that completely replaces the action bars as I cannot find a way to make this work without spreading taint  
- Update EditModeExpanded-1.0.lua  
- Fix potential lua error on fresh installs
