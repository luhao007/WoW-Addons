## [v3.7.0](https://github.com/Kiatra/BlizzMove/tree/v3.7.0) (2025-07-06)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Kiatra/BlizzMove/compare/v3.6.22...v3.7.0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Kiatra/BlizzMove/releases)

- Major overhaul to how protected frames (such as the spellbook and collections journal) are handled, to workaround blizzard ruining our fun in a random unannounced hotfix, with complete radio silence about it. -.-  
    Also fixed a small bug where frames at weird scales can sometimes drift when resetting their positions
