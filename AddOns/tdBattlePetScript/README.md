üêâ Battle Pet Combat Scriptingüêâ 

- Write scripts to automate pet battles
- Assign scripts to pet teams
- Full Rematch integration
- Export and share scripts

This addon is a fork of the popular, but now abandoned, [tdbattlePetScript](https://github.com/DengSir/tdBattlePetScript) addon.

## Getting Started
It is always a good idea to backup your `WTF` folder before replacing an addon to ensure no data is lost!  
If you already have `tdBattlePetScript` and `tdBattlePetScript_Rematch` installed, remove them both.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not remove any saved variables otherwise this will also wipe your scripts.**

You may find that uninstalling these also removes Rematch. If this happens, simply reinstall it.

Then download & install Pet Battle Scripts from either:
- [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pet-battle-scripts)
- [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/pbs)
- [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26435-PetBattleScripts.html)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/axc450/pbs/releases)

This addon takes the same name (`tdBattlePetScript`) under the hood so you should never have to transfer scripts over manually!

## Documentation & Support
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/axc450/pbs/wiki) for full addon documentation.
If there is a problem, please raise it [here](https://github.com/axc450/pbs/issues) or contact Super#0100 on Discord.
