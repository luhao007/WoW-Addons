[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-BCVanilla/compare/r675...r676) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-BCVanilla/releases)

- Removed DBM-Azeroth, it's being merged into DBM-Cores events mods. It was only written as a stand alone back in day so they'd be easier to back port to classic one day (and they were ported to classic, forward thinking paid). Now, however, they don't belong in this package anymore.  
- 9.x fixes (#9)
