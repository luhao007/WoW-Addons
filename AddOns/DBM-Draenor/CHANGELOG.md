[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WoD/compare/r58...r59) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WoD/releases)

- bump tocs  
- holy fucking debug spam, it's hard to test actual features with this mod generating hundreds of useless lines of debug for bullshit adds  
- Fixed lua error on darkmoc for missing voice pack version on superheated shrapnal  
    Fixed lua error that would occur in core if spear icons and conflict icons ran at same time on darmoc  
    Changed thogar target scan to cpu more efficient guid one. CID scans should only really be used when GUID isn't known.
