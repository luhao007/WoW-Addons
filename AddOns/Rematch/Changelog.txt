- Added a "help" text to the target list to describe green checkmarks if the option 'Hide Extra Help' is not checked.
- When both 'Compact List Mode' and 'Use Smaller Text Too' are checked, the options list uses smaller text too.
- Team lists slightly adjusted: target name font shrunk a tiny amount and team name allowed to wrap if user's font/scale allows.
- Fix for 'Hide Tooltip' option not working in Journal mode.

09/21/2020 version 4.11.2
- The Target button at the top of the loadout panel now pulls in a new target panel with a search box and a scrollable list of targets rather than the popout/context target menus. Clicking a target within the new panel will select that target.
- The target menus (still used in save dialogs) has been reworked to further group the 300+ notable targets by expansion.
- Added option 'Use Old Target Menu' under Targeting Options, for those who prefer the old context menu style over the new scrollable list of targets. This doesn't restore the old menu groupings; it restores the way the targets are chosen with the Target button.
- Added option 'Load Teams From Target Button' under Targeting Options, so that when a target with a saved team is chosen after clicking the Target button above your loaded pets, that saved team is loaded as it selects the target.

- Added the expansion a pet is from to the back of its pet card.
- Added Expansion submenu to the Filter menu to filter pets by expansion.

- For users of recent PetTracker versions, added "Show Breeds As Text Not Icons" under Appearance Options to show breeds in the more standard letter format (like H/P, B/B, etc.) rather than PetTracker's icons. If this option is not supported, the option is hidden.

02/29/2020 version 4.10.2
- Added a "Quality" tab to the pullout "Type Bar" beneath the pet search box (alongside "Type", "Strong vs" and "Tough vs"), to quickly turn on filters for level 25 pets, rare pets, and to set the sort order to Health, Power or Speed.

- Added option 'Show Import Button' in Toolbar Options, to add an import button to the toolbar to more easily import teams without opening any menus.
- Added sub-option 'Show After Pet Battle' -> 'But Not After PVP Battle' in Miscellaneous Options, to prevent automatically showing the Rematch window after leaving a PVP battle.
- Added option 'Use Random If Queue Empty' in Leveling Queue Options, to load a random high level pet into leveling slots when the queue is empty rather than leaving the leveling slot alone.
- Attempted fix for sub-option 'Load Healthiest Pet' -> 'After Pet Battles Too' from not properly loading abilities when an alternate pet is found.
- Fix for SetPoint bug on 8.2 clients when moving the standalone frame.
- Fix for the Load button being incorrectly enabled in an empty import dialog.

05/18/2019 version 4.9.8
- The leveling queue should now survive server-side petID reassignments, rather than being wiped.
- Added new option in Team Options: Load Healthiest Pet -> "After Pet Battles Too" to replace pets with their healthiest version after a battle or revive/bandages used within Rematch. (Revive, bandages and stable masters outside Rematch will not be noticed and have no effect.)
- Added new option in Team Options: "Show Icons For Pets In Teams" to display an icon beside pets that belong to a team.
- Added a new option category "Team Win Record Options" and moved existing options to this new category.
- While loadout slots are locked (such as while queued for a pvp pet battle) in dual pane or journal views, pet cards will appear and can be locked into place and interacted with, but the underlying slots will otherwise remain uninteractable. There is no change in behavior for single panel or minimized views yet, sorry! This will come in a future update.
- Better support for empty loadout slots for new players and server transfers: "empty" icon rather than red question mark for empty slots, "Unknown" name changed to "Battle Pet Slot #" with help text, text to explain how to unlock a slot if applicable.
- The icon signfiying a pet belongs to a team is now a green paw.

- Fix for bug where an action to automatically summon Rematch while Rematch is already summoned but not in the preferred mode will switch to the preferred mode.
- Removed one-time popup for Mac users about the retired experimental version.

Special note: If you manually update to this version while logged into the game, exit the game and log back in. Otherwise, new textures will be bright green squares until you exit.

04/07/2019 version 4.9.7
- Fix for potential scroll offset bug when pet list changes length.

03/22/2019 version 4.9.6

12/23/2018 version 4.9.3

12/22/2018 version 4.9.2
- Reworked how breeds are pulled from supported addons in pet card, menus and filtering system. (If you have any saved filters that filter breed, you may need to update those filters.)
- Removed Breed.lua since it's no longer needed.
- If Preferred Window Mode is set to Pet Journal, then the Targeting Options to show the window will open the Pet Journal and not standalone. (Unless Use Default Pet Journal is checked; then the targeting options will open the standalone window.)
- Fix for error trying to save/import/receive a team to a different tab before team panel has loaded in a session.
- Updated some old code to use newer petInfo system in loadout slots, pet card, and the pet filtering system.
- Added note back to Standalone Option "Use Custom Scale" that it doesn't affect the pet journal view of the addon.
- In save dialogs, the text is changed from center-justified to left-justified to fix a weird cursor offset bug.

12/14/2018 version 4.9.1
- Updated toc to 8.1

12/11/2018 version 4.9.0
- The MacOS crash issue appears to be fixed. (If you're a Mac user with any Debug options enabled, feel free to turn them all off now.)
- The major lists in the addon (pets, teams, queue, options) have been reworked with a custom scrollframe (AutoScrollFrame) while keeping the same overall look.
- Changing the Appearance Option "Compact List Mode" no longer requires a reload; lists will immediately change between compact and normal views.
- New Miscellaneous Option "Slow Mousewheel Scroll" will cause mousewheel scrolling over the lists to scroll one line at a time instead of a whole page at a time.
- Clicking the up or down arrows near each end of the scrollbar will always scroll up or down one line at a time.
- Clicking above or below the scrollbar thumb will have a "pressed" visual and always scroll up or down one page at a time.
- At the top and bottom of the scrollbars are little buttons to go to the top and bottom of the lists.
- The elements in the lists now use a custom button (CompositeButton) that uses textures instead of other buttons for mouse events to reduce the number and layering of buttons and textures. (For instance, the number of team panel objects were reduced by 63% between 4.8.10 and 4.9.0.)
- The pet card will remain up when the mouse is over a pet's notes button or the icon of the pet itself (in the lists).
- The small pullout panel at the top of the Teams tab--to show the currently loaded team--has been removed. All views of the addon already show the loaded team that can be interacted with right-click.
- The small pullout panel at the top of the Queue tab--to show the current leveling pet--has been removed. 
- Highlights of the pet currently showing the pet card is temporarily removed. (It will be back in a future update.)
- Right-clicking a pet in the team list will no longer have "Put Leveling Pet Here". Defining a leveling slot is now done only by right-clicking one of the slotted pets.
- The tiny floating numbers to toast win record changes has been removed.
- The "select" visual for summoned pets and loaded teams is now a border around the pet or team's name instead of their icons.
- Revoked pets (like Core Hound Pup with authenticator removed) have their icon colored red and name colored grey.
- Pet's that can't be summoned (like wrong-factioned Moonkin Hatchlings) have their icon and name colored grey.
- Pets that are revoked or can't be summoned now have a "Revoked" or "Can't Summon" stat on the pet card with tooltips to describe the state.
- The faction pets Lil' Siege Tower and Lil' War Machine will be dimmed and skipped in the leveling queue if you're playing the wrong faction and there are other available pets in the queue.
- Added new attributes to petInfo (usable in scripts): hasNotes, notes, isLeveling, and isSummoned.
- The text in the options list on German clients (deDE) will use a normal font size. (If this proves to be a problem let me know.)
- New files were added, so updating the addon while logged in with a /reload will warn that the addon is disabled until next login.

Known issues for 4.9.0:
- Rematch ElvUI Skin is not yet compatible with this update, sorry! That separate addon will need updated.
- Other addons that hook into Rematch may break with this update. (If you're an addon author, FillNewPetListButton replaces FillPetListButton; the code will be cleaned up later but I'll avoid changing names again to minimize breaking stuff.)
- When mousewheel scrolling over a pet icon in a list, you may see a semi-transparent icon of the first pet's icon floating over the new pet beneath the cursor. A more robust fix is in the works.
- If you'd prefer to go back to 4.8.10 due to these issues, 4.8.10 is compatible with the 8.1 client patch.

(Experimental changes from 4.8.9-experimental-01 to 06 that remained are are rolled into 4.9.0 changes listed above.)

10/29/2018 version 4.8.10
- Fix for lua error and interrupted open on 8.1 client (PTR)

09/30/2018 version 4.8.9
- MacOS users will get a one-time popup that says:

Attention MacOS users:
If the game occasionally crashes when you open Rematch, and you'd like to help troubleshoot, an experimental version of the addon is available at the URL below for testing solutions. Thank you for your patience!
http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24832-Rematch-Experimental.html

09/23/2018 version 4.8.8
- Fix for checkbutton missing on default journal to enable rematch+journal integration.
- deDE localization updated by Huk (EU-Thrall)

09/11/2016 version 4.8.7
- Fix for error when displaying the pet card of a leveling/random pet.

09/09/2018 version 4.8.6
- Added new debug option to troubleshoot Mac crashes: 'Debug: No Models' to run Rematch without any models. This option is OFF by default.
- Removed the default-on setting for 'Debug: Delay Journal On Macs' on Macs. If any currently have it on, it will remain on.
- Renamed the option 'Debug: Delay Journal on Macs' to 'Debug: Delay Journal' for use on any client.

Special note for MacOS users experiencing crashes:
- The new Debug: No Models option is OFF by default.
- If you can't even bring up options, copy and paste the following to chat to turn on the option and reload the UI:
    /run RematchSettings.DebugNoModels=true ReloadUI()
- Changing this setting requires reloading the UI to take effect.

09/01/2018 version 4.8.5
- Fix for new Mac debug options not doing what they were intended: if Blizzard_Collections is already loaded on login, wait until the journal is actually shown to setup Rematch.

09/01/2018 version 4.8.4
- Changed 'Delay Journal On Macs' delay from half a second to a full second.

08/31/2018 version 4.8.3
- Added new debug option 'Delay Journal On Macs' that's enabled by default for MacOS clients. When the pet journal launches for the first time in a session, it will delay Rematch taking over the journal by half a second.
- Added new suboption to the above 'Delay Just One Frame' to make Rematch take over the journal almost instantly with the above option set. This option is disabled by default.
- Added Kul Tiras and Zandalar world quest tamers to the notable target choices.
- The three Argus target menus (Antorian Wastes, Krokuun and Mac'Aree) are now combined into one.

Special note for MacOS users experiencing crashes:
- The experimental settings 'Delay Journal On Macs' will hopefully prevent crashes. If it seems to work, try enabling 'Delay Just One Frame' too. Please let me know your findings.
- For those who use the standalone Rematch window: the above setting only relate to those who open Rematch in the pet journal. I understand the standalone window crashes too, but the new setting won't affect it.
- Thanks again for your patience!

08/08/2018 version 4.8.2
- Added a new options category 'Debugging Options'
- Moved option 'Debug: Journal FrameLevel' to this new category.
- Added option 'Debug: No Cache' to disable the automatic caching of NPC names.
- Added option 'Debug: No Sanctuary' to disable the system that protects against server petID reassignments.
- Teams are now checked for corruption on login, with instructions on what to do if any is encountered.
- While ElvUI and RematchElvUISkin are both enabled, the version of the latter will display at the end of options.

Special note for those experiencing crashes:
- If you're NOT on a MacOS client, let me know. So far crashes seem limited to MacOS.
- If you haven't, make a backup of WTF or Rematch's SavedVariable deep in WTF folder. Crashes are the #1 cause of addons losing data. (A backup of Interface\Addons\Rematch will not be useful. No saved data is stored there. Backup WTF instead.)
- If you're unsure how to backup WTF, and you can open the addon with /rematch, go to the Teams tab and choose 'Backup All Teams' from the Teams button at the top of the panel.
- Try to enable 'Debug: No Cache' and 'Debug: No Sanctuary' in the new 'Debugging Options' category and see if that helps.
- If you can't open Rematch to set those options, copy and paste this to chat to set those options and reload the UI:
/run RematchSettings.DebugNoCache=true RematchSettings.DebugNoSanctuary=true ReloadUI()
- Let me know if this solves the problem or not, or if you experience any other issues.
- Thank you for your patience!

- When exceeding 14 tabs, up/down buttons will appear above/below the tabs to scroll through them
- Mousewheel over the team tabs will also scroll through tabs while they're scrollable
- Added option 'Allow Random Pets From Teams' under Team Options. While this is enabled, random slots will choose from a pool of pets that includes pets saved in other teams. (The default behavior is to avoid slotting random pets from other teams so they're not pulled into service before you need them.)

01/31/2018 version 4.7.11
- Added option 'Use Level In Strong Vs Filter' under Pet Filter Options. This will limit the filter results to pets who are high enough level to use the abilities that are strong vs the chosen type.

11/12/2017 version 4.7.8
- To selectively hide pets in the pet list, the new option "Allow Hidden Pets" under the Pet Filter Options in the Options tab is now required. If you already have hidden pets, this option will be on by default. If you do not, it will be off by default. While this option is off, the various menu options related to hiding pets will be hidden.
- Added temporary option "Debug: Journal FrameLevel" under Miscellaneous Options, for an experimental fix for a few having problems opening Rematch in the Collections window.
- Fix for areas beneath notes being unclickable when there's more notes extending beyond the bottom.

09/30/2017 version 4.7.7
- Secondary accounts can once again run Rematch concurrently with the main account.
- When sorting pets by level, non-battle pets are now treated as if level 0. (Secondary sorts by level do not do this yet but will in a future update.)

- Searches should now reliably be case-insensitive for deDE clients.

09/02/2017 version 4.7.6

- deDE localization updated by Salty from curse.com.
- zhCN localization updated by Yonshuo from curse.com.

07/11/2017 version 4.7.3

- Added new option to pet list right-click menu: 'Find Moveset' to find all pets that share the same moveset as the chosen pet.
- Added new pet filter: Other -> 'Unique Moveset' to filter the pet list to battle pets with movesets unique to their species.
- Added new pet filter: Other -> 'Shared Moveset' to filter the pet list to battle pets with movesets that other species also share.
- Added new option to Pet Filter Options in the Options tab: 'Hide Non-Battle Pets' to remove from the pet list companion pets that cannot battle.
- Elekk Plushie will no longer be chosen for a random pet.
- Added "On-Demand Table" system (ODTables) and moved pets in teams, pet sourceIDs, species at 25, and movesets to the new system.

Special note: Don't forget to occasionally backup your teams! Either the WTF folder or in-game from the Teams button menu -> Backup All Teams. An upcoming update will be changing the format teams are stored. It will be heavily tested and my hope is nobody notices any difference; but just in case!

06/26/2017 version 4.7.2
- When loaded ability numbers are enabled (Appearance Options->Show Ability Numbers->On Loaded Abilities Too) they will appear in the minimized view also.

- zhTW localization updated by gaspy10 on curse.com.
- ruRU localization updated by Gizmi on curse.com.

06/20/2017 version 4.7.1
- Random slots will prefer pets not in a team and at full health. Injured pets will have a higher priority than dead pets.
- If all three slots in a team are random, it will disregard whether the random pet is in a team, but health preference still applies. This allows loading a team of totally random (healthy) pets.
- If no chosen random pet type is available when a team loads, and 'Don't Warn About Missing Pets' is not checked in Confirmation Options, a missing pet dialog will appear.
- Added option 'Randomize Abilities Too' under Team Options, to randomize the abilities of random pets.
- Added inTeams and numTeams to petInfo (usable in script filters).
- Added a few strings left out of localization.

- Ignored slots will be left alone when a team loads.
- Random slots will load a random high level/rarity pet of any type or a single type if chosen.

- Added two new queue sort options to the Queue button's menu: Favorites First and Rares First. These will group favorites and/or rares to the top of the queue. If Active Sort is enabled alongside either option they will always be sorted to the top; otherwise it is a one-time sort like the rest.
- The "Type" queue sort order has been removed.

Choosing a new Preferred Window Mode will confirm the choice and then Reload the UI.

- On the pet card for pets in the team list, the "search hit" gold border is removed for abilities used by the pet and abilities not used are greyed out instead.

- The quarter-second delay before a pet card or note displays has been added to ability cards, which can be turned off with "Faster Pet Cards & Notes" under the Pet Cards & Notes options.

  - The pet filtering process has been reworked to be more efficient. Instead of checking each filter for every pet, it will only check active filters. Reusable tables are more intelligently reused. And key parts are better optimized for speed. 
  - The system to handle petIDs changing (whether due to a wholesale server petID reassignment or to a caged and relearned pet) has been reworked for reliability and to reduce the time spent monitoring changes in your pets.
  - The process of updating the internal data and updating the UI to reflect that data was made more internally consistent across the addon.
- When loading a target from the target panel before reaching that target, auto load will not reload the team, removing any changes you made while on the way to that target.
- When the mouse is over a team in the team list, it will highlight the tab its from.
- When "Fill Queue More" is used multiple times, each attempt will grab a qualifying pet from each species regardless of whether any are already queued or at 25.
- Added support for patch 6.2.4 battle.net changes.
- Fix for "Fill Queue" sometimes behaving like "Fill Queue More".
- Fix for "Keep On Screen" sub-option "Even Across Sessions" being active even when Keep On Screen disabled.
- Fix for multiple pets learned very quickly not being recognized.

02/10/2016 version 4.1.10

- Added right-click menu to abilities on the pet card and loadout slots to "Find Pets With This Ability".
- Ability searches by the old double click or the new menu will use quotes to limit to just those abilities.

- Export, Import and Script Filter multi-line editboxes now use the common dialog multi-line editbox.

01/25/2016 version 4.1.8

- Made the pet type textures in pet/queue normal lists a little brighter so they're easier to see.
- Changed pet card ability type textures to a style similar to pet lists.

01/15/2016 version 4.1.7
- Korean (koKR) localization by IrisNib from curse.com.
- The code for the arrangement of the standalone window has been rewritten.
- Toolbar and panel buttons reworked:
  - In the single panel view, the window now defaults to using the red panel buttons (Save/Save As/Find Battle) across the bottom, and the toolbar buttons are moved to the top. This is to make the journal, dual panel and single panel views consistent.
  - The order of toolbar buttons are slightly rearranged to be in a consistent order across all views. Default from left to right: Revive Battle Pets, Battle Pet Bandage, Safari Hat, Lesser Pet Treat, Pet Treat, Summon Random Pet, Save, Save As and Find Battle.
  - Added option "Move Toolbar To Bottom" in new option category "Toolbar Options" to move the toolbar to the bottom of single panel and dual panel views.
  - The "Reverse Toolbar Buttons" option is moved to "Toolbar Options" and will reverse the order of all buttons instead of some.
  - To minimize the impact of the above changes to existing users, when an existing user logs in to the update, a one-time check will see if they have Single Panel Mode active.  If so, "Move Toolbar To Bottom" will be automatically checked and "Reverse Toolbar Buttons" will be reversed.
  - The little "Pet Count" window in the journal and dual panel view is also being added to the toolbar in single panel view when space permits.
  - Cooldown spinners added to Safari Hat, Battle Pet Bandage, and Summon Random Pet buttons.
- Trimmed extra space on right edge of tooltips when text wraps early.

- Files removed: NarrowPanel.xml NarrowPanel.lua TopPanel.xml TopPanel.lua.
- Files added: Configure.lua Collection.xml Collection.lua.

01/04/2016 version 4.1.6
- Chinese (zhTW) localization by gaspy10 from curse.com.
- Clicking a treat button while its buff is active will warn that the buff is already up and abort the cast. (Casting a treat while a buff is active would not increase its duration.)
- When logging in with a treat buff active from a previous session, its cooldown spinner will reflect the remaining time since you logged in. (This is a temporary workaround until the cooldown bug is fixed on Blizzard's end.)
- Fix for bug with script filter iterator function AllAbilities causing abilities to be misread (most notably causing non-unique pets to list with Unique Pets script filter).
- Fix for lua error when breed filtering encounters a "New" breed via Battle Pet Breed ID.

01/01/2016 version 4.1.5

- Fix for queue's scrollbar being disabled when its height changes and it would not be needed at full height but is needed at a shortened height.
- Fix for pinned pet card flickering or not showing when mouse happens to be over where possible breeds would be displayed.

- A few default script filters are included:
  - Unnamed Pets: Collected pets that still have their original name.
