- TOC bump.  
- - Added hint to press Enter to save when editing.  
    - When editing, we backup the format and if we don't save we restore it back to how it was originally.  
    - Storing empty format will reset it back to how it was before the user started editing.  
- Added back the backdrop on the edit box for the sake of clarity.
